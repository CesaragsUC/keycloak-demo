Keycloak is an open-source Identity and Access Management (IAM) tool. It provides authentication and authorization for modern applications, enabling Single Sign-On (SSO), support for multiple protocols such as OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, and SAML, and integration with third-party identity providers such as Google and Microsoft. Keycloak simplifies the management of users, groups, roles, and permissions in distributed systems and is widely used in microservices architectures.
